# MITRE ATT&CK 

## Description
MITRE ATT&CK is a structured matrix of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries at various stages of a cyberattack (https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/). It categorizes attacker activities from initial access to post-exploitation objectives. ATT&CK helps describe and analyze adversary activities in the real world. The matrix is ​​continually updated and expanded to account for new threats and techniques.

## Practice
MITRE ATT&CK is used to model attacks, analyze incidents, and build defense strategies. Analysts use the matrix to understand the tactics and techniques used by pentesters or attackers at different stages of a cyberattack, which helps in incident investigation and defense planning. The matrix helps in creating detailed incident reports, identifying security gaps, and implementing measures to eliminate them. MITRE ATT&CK also helps develop scenarios for red and blue teams, which helps improve practical skills in attack and defense.

## Connection with other knowledge
MITRE ATT&CK is closely related to CVE and CVSS, as the techniques in the matrix can be linked to specific vulnerabilities and their severity. Using ATT&CK is also effective when combined with frameworks such as Cyber ​​Kill Chain, which help build a more complete understanding of the attack cycle. The matrix is ​​often used in SIEM systems to correlate events and identify threats based on known techniques, and is also used to automate security testing and system monitoring.

## How to improve
- Take official MITRE training: https://attack.mitre.org/resources/learn-more-about-attack/training/cti/
- Study the official MITRE ATT&CK documentation to understand how tactics and techniques are structured and how they are used in different phases of attacks.
- Practice analyzing incidents using the ATT&CK matrix to determine what techniques attackers used and how they could have been detected or prevented.
- Review attack reports that used ATT&CK techniques to understand how real-world incidents compare to the matrix.
- Integrate MITRE ATT&CK knowledge into your regular activities by demonstrating how each technique or tactic was used in an attack and what steps could be taken to prevent it.
