# CWE & CAPEC

## Description
CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration, https://cwe.mitre.org/) is a catalog of software weaknesses that helps identify and classify typical vulnerabilities in software. CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification, https://capec.mitre.org/) is a database that describes attack patterns used by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. CWE focuses on weaknesses that can be eliminated, and CAPEC on how to exploit them. Using these resources together allows you to better understand which vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers and by what methods, as well as to develop effective measures to eliminate them and prevent attacks.

## Practice
In the work of an analyst, CWE & CAPEC can be used for:
- Analyzing vulnerabilities identified as a result of penetration tests and preparing recommendations for their elimination.
- Studying attack patterns to predict potential threats and propose scenarios for protecting the system under study.
- Creating reports on typical vulnerabilities and attack techniques used.
- Developing recommendations for preventing attacks based on the flaws described in CWE and attack techniques from CAPEC.

## Connection with other knowledge
CWE & CAPEC are closely related to other aspects of cybersecurity, such as:
- MITRE ATT&CK: CAPEC describes attack methods that can be supplemented with tactics and techniques from ATT&CK.
- OWASP Top 10: Many of the flaws in CWE overlap with the vulnerability categories described in the OWASP Top 10.
- Vulnerability Management: CWE helps analyze identified flaws, and CAPEC provides insight into how they can be exploited by attackers.
- Monitoring Tools: CAPEC can be used to generate indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on common attack techniques.

## How to improve
- Understand the major flaw categories in CWE to understand which vulnerabilities are most common and how to avoid them.
- Learn attack patterns from CAPEC to better understand how attackers exploit vulnerabilities and develop mitigations.
- Practice using CWE & CAPEC in conjunction with other frameworks, such as MITRE ATT&CK, to create a more comprehensive threat analysis.
- Use CWE to analyze vulnerabilities found in penetration tests and learn recommendations for remediation.
- Keep up-to-date with CWE & CAPEC database updates to stay up-to-date with new flaws and attack patterns.
