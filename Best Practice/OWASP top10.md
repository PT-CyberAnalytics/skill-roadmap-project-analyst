# OWASP top10

## Description
The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the ten most critical and prevalent web application threats developed by the OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project, https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). The list is updated every few years and is used by security professionals to raise awareness of the risks associated with web application development.

## Practice
The OWASP Top 10 is widely used in web application audits, especially in pentesting and security analysis. Analysts and pentesters use this list as a basis for checking the security of web applications and generating reports. Web developers also rely on this list to implement security best practices in the development process. Examples of vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10 are common, and their exploitation by attackers can lead to serious consequences.

## Connection with other knowledge
The OWASP Top 10 is closely related to the CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) and CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) projects. Each vulnerability in the OWASP Top 10 list has a corresponding CWE code, which helps to detail the nature of the vulnerability. CVSS is used to rate the severity of these vulnerabilities, which helps to prioritize their mitigation. In addition, the MITRE ATT&CK matrix can be used to describe the tactics and techniques that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities from the OWASP Top 10.

## How to improve
- Study the official OWASP Top 10 documentation to understand each vulnerability type, examples of its exploitation, and protection methods.
- Practice detecting OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using web application security testing tools such as Burp Suite in training labs or on bug bounties.
- Study real attack cases related to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities to understand how they are used by attackers.
- Practice your knowledge in labs and testing grounds such as hack-the-box, try-hack-me, port swigger camp, standoff365.
- Follow updates and new versions of OWASP Top 10 to stay up to date with current web security threats.
