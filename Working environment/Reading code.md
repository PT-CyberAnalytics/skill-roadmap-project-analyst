# Reading code

## Description
Code Reading is the skill of analyzing and understanding program code, scripts, and sample requests provided for examination or interpretation. This skill is especially important for an analyst who works with data from pentesters, Blue Team specialists. The analyst's task is to understand the essence of the provided fragments, such as HTTP requests, scripts, or other artifacts, and extract key information from them for incident analysis or preparation of recommendations.

## Practice
Code reading can be used in the following scenarios:
- Analyzing code snippets provided by pentesters: Understanding the logic of exploits, vulnerabilities, and interactions between application components.
- Parsing HTTP requests and responses: Interpreting penetration tests such as SQL injection or XSS attacks.
- Interpreting configurations: Examining system and application configuration files to identify potential weaknesses.
- Analysis of a malicious script: Understanding what actions an attacker could perform using provided scripts or vulnerabilities.

## Connection with other knowledge
Code reading is closely related to other aspects of analytical work:
- Threat Intelligence: Understanding the methods and tools used by attackers helps to better interpret their actions recorded in the code.
- Threat Hunting: Analysis of suspicious scripts or code left by attackers helps in finding additional traces of an attack.
- Vulnerabilities: Understanding typical web vulnerabilities (e.g. OWASP Top 10) and their code allows for more accurate risk assessment and preparation of recommendations.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of programming and scripting languages ​​such as Python, JavaScript, PowerShell, Bash to understand the code samples you work with.
- Practice reading and parsing HTTP requests and their structure to identify possible attacks on web applications.
- Learn the main types of vulnerabilities and their examples (e.g. SQL injection, XSS) to understand the logic of their exploitation.
- Work with reports and examples from pentests to practice interpreting the provided fragments.
- Use resources such as CTF (Capture The Flag) to practice reading code and analyzing attack actions.
- Read articles on code and vulnerability analysis to expand theoretical knowledge and find new approaches to work.
