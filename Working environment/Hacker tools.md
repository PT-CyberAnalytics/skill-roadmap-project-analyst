# Hacker tools

## Description
Hacking tools are tools used for penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, monitoring network traffic, and performing attacks. It is important for an analyst to understand how these tools work in order to interpret the results provided by pentesters or Blue Teams and accurately describe them in reports. Knowing hacking tools also helps to better understand the actions of attackers and the methods they may use to attack.

## Practice
An analyst can use knowledge of hacker tools to:
- Interpret data: Analyze screenshots, reports, and logs provided by penetration testers to understand the nature and scale of vulnerabilities found.
- Identify attack methods: Understand which tools could have been used by attackers and analyze their traces in logs.
- Create recommendations: Prepare recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities and improving protection based on the results obtained using the tools.
- Threat Assessments: Understanding how easily a particular vulnerability can be exploited using standard tools.
- Analysis of reports: Correct description of the results of utilities in analytical materials.

## Connection with other knowledge
Hacking tools are related to:
- Vulnerabilities: For example, Burp Suite helps you search for web vulnerabilities such as XSS or SQL injections.
- Threat Hunting: Knowing the tools that attackers can use helps you search for traces of their activity in your infrastructure.
- Information security tools: The results of the tools help you improve the settings of SIEM, EDR, and other security tools.
- Code reading: Some tools provide code or logs that need to be interpreted to understand the actions of attackers.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of popular tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, and BloodHound to understand their functionality and output.
- Practice analyzing reports and screenshots created using the tools to develop skills in interpreting their results.
- Learn the testing methods implemented in such tools to understand what vulnerabilities they detect and how they do so.
- Keep an eye on new tools used by penetration testers and attackers to stay up to date with the latest attack methods.
- Participate in CTF games and labs where hacker tools are used to consolidate theoretical knowledge into practice.
- Review the documentation and tutorials for each utility to better understand its capabilities.
- Practice creating recommendations based on data obtained from tools and integrating these recommendations into reports.
- Master the basic methods of working with logs and network traffic to use data from Wireshark and similar tools.
