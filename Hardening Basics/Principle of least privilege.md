# Principle of least privilege

## Description
Privilege minimization is the principle that users, systems, and applications should have only the rights and access necessary to perform their tasks. This helps limit potential attack vectors and reduce the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data. Applying this principle helps prevent privilege escalation, where attackers gain access to an account with excessive rights and use it to carry out further attacks.

## Practice
The analyst needs to evaluate whether the assigned privileges comply with the principle of least necessary access and recommend removing excess rights. This may include setting up roles and access policies, monitoring system accounts, restricting the use of accounts with administrative rights, and implementing multi-layered authentication mechanisms to improve security. An important task is to regularly audit access rights to prevent excessive privileges.

## Connection with other knowledge
Privilege minimization is closely related to password management, authentication, network security, and operating system security. For example, effective privilege management can reduce the likelihood of key accounts and access to critical systems being compromised. Privilege control is closely integrated with identity and access management (IAM) systems and role-based access control (RBAC) policies.

## How to improve
- Learn the principles of role-based access control (RBAC) and how to configure privileges in operating systems and applications to minimize risks.
- Develop skills in working with identity and access management (IAM) systems to effectively control privileges and restrict access to critical resources.
- Keep up to date with current privilege management practices and emerging technologies, such as Zero Trust, that help minimize access and protect systems from attackers.
- Understand best practices for segregating privileges (e.g. using accounts with limited privileges for daily tasks and administrative accounts for special actions only).
- Participate in training and workshops on access and privilege management to stay current on current technologies and methods for protecting against privilege escalation.
