# Network Security

## Description
Network security is a set of measures aimed at protecting network infrastructure from unauthorized access, attacks, and data leaks. It includes the use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPN for secure remote access, and network traffic monitoring to detect anomalies. Approaches such as network segmentation and the creation of demilitarized zones (DMZ) play an important role in network security. These methods help minimize risks by isolating critical network components and restricting access to them.

## Practice
In their daily work, an analyst needs to be able to provide recommendations on how to properly configure firewalls, analyze network logs for suspicious activity, conduct regular vulnerability checks in the network infrastructure, and provide secure remote access for employees via VPN. For example, knowledge of how DMZ works allows you to assess how publicly accessible resources (web servers, mail gateways) are isolated from the internal network. It is also necessary to periodically test the network for vulnerabilities, analyze network segments, and use perimeter protection solutions such as IDS/IPS. Timely detection and blocking of threats helps prevent attacks and reduce risks to the company's infrastructure.

## Connection with other knowledge
Network security is closely related to patch management, web application security, and privilege and password management. For example, unprotected network devices with outdated software can become vulnerable to attacks. Understanding DMZ and network segmentation is important for analyzing the network infrastructure topology and identifying potential weak points. Network security management should be integrated with real-time event monitoring using SIEM systems to quickly detect anomalies. Network security is also related to physical security, as physical access to network devices can lead to compromise.

## How to improve
- Learn how network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) work and how to protect them from attacks.
- Learn how to create and manage a DMZ (demilitarized zone): what it is, why and when it is used, and examples of how to set it up.
- Learn the concept of network segmentation: what types of segmentation exist (e.g. VLAN, microsegmentation) and how they help restrict access and minimize risks.
- Learn how firewalls work to protect the network perimeter and control incoming and outgoing traffic.
- Learn the basics of working with IDS/IPS systems to detect and block suspicious network activity in real time.
- Learn how to create and protect VPN connections to ensure secure remote access to corporate resources.
- Keep an eye on current threats related to network attacks, such as DDoS and MITM, and learn methods for preventing and mitigating them.
- Learn about network traffic analysis tools like Wireshark to identify anomalies and diagnose network security issues.
- Learn the basics of monitoring and analyzing network logs through SIEM systems to detect attacks and prevent intrusions in a timely manner.
- Participate in network security courses and seminars to stay up to date with the latest technologies and approaches to protecting your network infrastructure.
