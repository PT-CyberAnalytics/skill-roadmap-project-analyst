# Patch Management

## Description
Patch management is the process of planning, testing, and installing updates to software, operating systems, and devices to fix vulnerabilities, improve performance, and introduce new features. Regularly updating systems is a critical defense measure, as many vulnerabilities and attacks are based on the use of outdated versions of software. Updates include both security fixes and functionality updates that help close potential vulnerabilities.

## Practice
The analyst must be able to evaluate the organization's patch management - whether operating systems, software and network devices are regularly updated. An important aspect is planning and coordinating the installation of critical updates that close identified vulnerabilities, as well as testing updates before installing them to avoid system failures. In addition, the analyst can suggest automating the update process for key systems and applications to minimize the risks of using outdated software.

## Connection with other knowledge
Patch management is directly related to the security of operating systems, applications, and network devices. Outdated software with known vulnerabilities can become a target for malicious attacks. Patch management is also related to network security and antivirus protection, as timely updates can prevent the spread of malware and exploitation of vulnerabilities. This process should be integrated into the overall security management system, including the use of SIEM and other monitoring systems.

## How to improve
- Learn modern patch management techniques such as WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) and automated updates via SCCM (System Center Configuration Manager) to manage updates at the organization level.
- Understand processes for testing updates before installing them to ensure that updates do not disrupt critical systems.
- Stay informed about current vulnerabilities and security patches via resources such as NVD (National Vulnerability Database) or CVE to ensure timely deployment of critical fixes.
- Practice setting up automated update management systems to minimize the risks of using outdated software on the corporate network.
- Monitor security monitoring systems for updates and integrate update management with vulnerability management systems to track all updated and unpatched network components.
- Participate in update management and software lifecycle management training programs and courses to better understand how to effectively implement an update management policy in the organization.
