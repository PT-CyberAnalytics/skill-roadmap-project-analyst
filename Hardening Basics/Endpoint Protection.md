# Endpoint Protection

## Description
Host-based protection involves using traditional antivirus tools to detect and eliminate known threats. These tools operate at the signature and behavioral analysis level, which makes it possible to detect most common malware. When combined with modern technologies such as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), antivirus solutions provide a basic level of protection that can be expanded with monitoring, analysis, and automated threat response tools.

## Practice
As part of host protection, the analyst can:
Analyze logs and reports from antivirus solutions to identify malicious activity.
Work with data from EDR systems to identify suspicious activity, such as unknown processes, network connections, or privilege escalation attempts.
Understand antivirus solution settings to assess their level of protection and suggest optimizations.
Prepare recommendations for the implementation and configuration of antivirus systems and EDR to improve endpoint security.
Explore the effectiveness of various host security approaches, such as whitelisting, blocking malicious scripts, and restricting access.

## Connection with other knowledge
Host security is closely related to:
Vulnerability Management: Antivirus and EDR systems help prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities on endpoints.
Monitoring and response: EDR integrates with SIEM systems to analyze incidents and correlate security event data.
Privilege minimization: Limiting access rights on hosts is a key element of endpoint security.
Network security: Host-based security works with network security tools such as firewalls to prevent attacks at the network level.

## How to improve
- Learn the basic principles of antivirus solutions: signature analysis, behavioral analysis, and sandboxing technologies.
- Learn the principles of popular EDR solutions, such as CrowdStrike Falcon, SentinelOne, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, to understand their capabilities and limitations.
- Practice analyzing logs and reports from antivirus systems and EDR to identify malicious activity and compile analytical reports.
- Familiarize yourself with the concept of application whitelisting and execution policy management to minimize risks on endpoints.
- Develop skills in assessing the effectiveness of current protection tools and preparing recommendations for their improvement.
- Follow new technologies in the field of host protection, such as XDR (Extended Detection and Response), to stay up to date with modern approaches.
