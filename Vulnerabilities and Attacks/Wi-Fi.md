# Wi-Fi

## Description
Wi-Fi is a key technology for wirelessly connecting devices to a network. Vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks can include weak encryption configuration, use of outdated security standards such as WEP or WPA, improper access settings, and vulnerabilities in the access points themselves. These flaws can allow attackers to intercept traffic, gain unauthorized access to the network, or conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

## Practice
Security experts test wireless networks for vulnerabilities using methods such as sniffing traffic, assessing encryption levels, checking authentication settings, and deploying rogue access points. After conducting these tests, analysts receive data that they interpret to generate a report with recommendations for improving security. For example, if a vulnerability is found related to the outdated WPA encryption standard, an analyst might suggest upgrading to more modern protocols such as WPA3 and recommend regularly reviewing security configurations.

## Connection with other knowledge
Vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks are related to network security in general, as they can become an entry point for attackers into a corporate network. The severity of these vulnerabilities can be assessed using CVSS, which helps assess the risks to the infrastructure. MITRE ATT&CK describes techniques related to the exploitation of Wi-Fi vulnerabilities, such as interception of authentication data or exploitation of weak encryption. Securing wireless networks is also related to physical security, as attackers can use available Wi-Fi networks for remote attacks.

## How to improve
- Learn about wireless security standards like WPA2 and WPA3, as well as legacy standards, to understand the risks associated with using them.
- Learn about Wi-Fi security testing tools like Wireshark and Aircrack-ng to better understand wireless attack methods.
- Keep an eye on current vulnerabilities in access points and other wireless devices to ensure they are taken into account when creating reports and recommendations.
- Attend wireless security courses and workshops to improve your knowledge and stay up to date with the latest Wi-Fi security techniques.
