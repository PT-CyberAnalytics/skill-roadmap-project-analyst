# WEB

## Description
The "WEB" section covers vulnerabilities and attacks related to web applications. These vulnerabilities can occur due to design errors, incorrect server configurations, lack of user data validation, and weak authentication or authorization mechanisms. Such vulnerabilities include SQL injections, XSS (cross-site scripting), CSRF (cross-site request forgery), and others. These flaws can be used by attackers to control vulnerable application servers, gain access to confidential information, personal accounts, or even steal money.

## Practice
Analysts obtain data from penetration tests and security assessments that contain information about vulnerabilities in web applications. Based on this data, analysts prepare reports for customers, describing the identified risks and providing recommendations for eliminating vulnerabilities. For example, when an SQL injection is detected, an analyst must explain how this vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker and suggest methods for eliminating it, such as using parameterized queries.

## Connection with other knowledge
Web application vulnerabilities are closely related to the OWASP Top 10 and CWE classification, which helps to systematize and describe each weakness. CVSS is used to assess the severity of vulnerabilities, which helps to prioritize fixes. Web vulnerabilities can also be related to techniques described in MITRE ATT&CK, such as initial access tactics. Some attacks on web applications can include elements of social engineering, when attackers try to trick users into performing malicious actions through the web interface.

## How to improve
- Study the OWASP Top 10 to gain a deep understanding of common web vulnerabilities and their characteristics.
- Read real incident reports of web application attacks to better understand the impact of vulnerability exploitation.
- Practice analyzing security analyst reports and develop clear recommendations to address identified weaknesses.
- Participate in web application security training programs and workshops to maintain up-to-date knowledge of vulnerabilities and protection methods.
- Keep an eye on new threats and attack methods for web applications to keep your reports and recommendations up-to-date.
