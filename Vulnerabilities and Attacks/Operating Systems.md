# Operating Systems

## Description
Operating systems (OS) such as Windows, Linux, and macOS are the foundation for the operation of IT infrastructure. Vulnerabilities in OS can be due to incorrect security settings, outdated software versions, misconfigured privileges, or bugs in system components. Such vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or escalate privileges. Examples of such flaws include vulnerabilities in SMB services, security issues in the OS kernel, or attacks on authentication processes, to name a few.

## Practice
Security analysts identify vulnerabilities in operating systems using a variety of tools and techniques, such as configuration audits, penetration tests, and automated scanners. This data is passed to analysts, who interpret it and compile reports with detailed recommendations for remediating the vulnerabilities. For example, if a vulnerability related to an out-of-date security patch in Windows was discovered, the analyst would explain the risk and suggest a timely system update or additional protection setup.

## Connection with other knowledge
Vulnerabilities in operating systems are directly related to the security of other components of the IT infrastructure, such as network devices, applications and databases. Using CVSS, you can assess the criticality of OS vulnerabilities and prioritize their elimination. Methods for exploiting OS vulnerabilities are also often described in MITRE ATT&CK, which helps model attack scenarios. Operating system security is closely related to hardening, as well as patch and update management.

## How to improve
- Learn the architecture and operating principles of various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS) to better understand how vulnerabilities arise.
- Learn about modern methods of protecting operating systems, including setting up security policies, regularly updating and applying patches, and protecting against exploits.
- Follow the latest news and publications on vulnerabilities in operating systems and quickly study information about new attack methods and protection against them.
- Participate in courses or seminars on OS security to improve your knowledge and understand how to strengthen the protection of corporate systems at the operating system level.
