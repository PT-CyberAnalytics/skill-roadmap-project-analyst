# Social Engineering

## Description
Social engineering is a technique by which attackers manipulate people to gain access to sensitive information or systems. It can include phishing, voice calls (vishing), identity spoofing, and other methods. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering attacks primarily target the human factor and can be very effective because they bypass security measures by directly affecting the user.

## Practice
Penetration testers can simulate social engineering attacks, such as phishing campaigns, to test how susceptible a company’s employees are to these threats. The results of these tests and training programs are passed on to analysts, who analyze the company’s vulnerability to social attacks and develop recommendations for improving user awareness and implementing defense mechanisms. For example, if employees are found to be susceptible to phishing, an analyst might suggest improving cybersecurity training and implementing technical protections to prevent malicious emails from being received.

## Connection with other knowledge
Social engineering is closely related to phishing and other attack methods described in MITRE ATT&CK, which outline techniques for manipulating users to gain access to credentials or install malware. Such attacks often serve as a first step for other types of cyberattacks, such as hacking networks or systems. Defenses against social engineering include not only user education, but also technical measures such as two-factor authentication, monitoring network activity to prevent successful attacks, and secure email configuration.

## How to improve
- Learn basic social engineering techniques such as phishing, vishing, SMS phishing, and messaging attacks to understand how attackers manipulate users.
- Learn the psychological principles attackers use to manipulate, such as creating a sense of urgency or false trust.
- Keep an eye on new social engineering tactics and techniques to understand how they are evolving and what steps can be taken to prevent such attacks.
- Participate in cybersecurity training programs and workshops to learn how to effectively train employees and develop policies to combat social attacks.
