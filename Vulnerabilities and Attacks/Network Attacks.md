# Network Attacks

## Description
Network attacks are aimed at exploiting vulnerabilities in network infrastructure and protocols, as well as intercepting and analyzing network traffic. These attacks may include methods such as DDoS (distributed denial of service attacks), traffic interception, exploitation of weak network device configurations, protocol attacks (such as ARP spoofing), and network authentication attacks. The goal of the attackers is to gain access to information, disrupt network operation, or penetrate systems through vulnerable points in the network infrastructure.

## Practice
Security experts test network infrastructure for vulnerabilities using methods such as traffic analysis, port scanning, network device configuration testing, and network attack simulations. This data is passed on to analysts, who analyze the risks associated with network vulnerabilities and develop recommendations for strengthening the network infrastructure. For example, if a vulnerability is detected due to an incorrect firewall configuration, an analyst may suggest revising the traffic filtering policy and configuring rules based on the principle of least privilege.

## Connection with other knowledge
Network attacks are often part of more complex attacks that involve social engineering or attacks on authentication systems. Attack methods such as DDoS, MITM (man-in-the-middle), and attacks on various network protocols are described in MITRE ATT&CK, which helps to better understand how attackers can penetrate or disrupt a network. Assessing network vulnerabilities with CVSS helps to prioritize their remediation based on the potential impact on the infrastructure. Protecting against network attacks is closely related to other aspects such as Wi-Fi security, VPN configuration, and firewalls.

## How to improve
- Learn the fundamentals of network security, including the OSI and TCP/IP models, to understand how vulnerabilities arise at different network layers.
- Learn about network traffic analysis tools, such as Wireshark and Nmap, to understand how attackers can scan and analyze networks to find vulnerabilities.
- Keep up-to-date with current vulnerabilities in network devices and protocols, such as routers, switches, and firewalls, to stay up-to-date with recommendations on how to protect them.
- Attend network security seminars and training to stay up-to-date on the latest methods for protecting networks and effectively combating network attacks.
