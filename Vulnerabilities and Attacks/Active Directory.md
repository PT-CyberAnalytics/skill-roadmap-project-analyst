# Active Directory

## Description
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that is used to manage and authenticate users, devices, and resources on enterprise networks. Vulnerabilities in Active Directory can include misconfigured security policies, weak passwords, use of outdated authentication protocols, or improper management of access rights. Such vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain control of accounts, escalate their network privileges, and gain access to critical company data.

## Practice
Analysts receive information about Active Directory attacks from incident response specialists or penetration testers. This data may include information about misconfigurations, privilege escalations, or exploitation of weaknesses in authentication mechanisms. The analystâ€™s job is to interpret this data, describe the potential impact of such vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations for remediation. For example, if a vulnerability is discovered due to the use of the legacy NTLM protocol, the analyst should explain how this can be used for authentication attacks and suggest an upgrade to the more secure Kerberos protocol.

## Connection with other knowledge
Active Directory vulnerabilities often overlap with other security areas such as privilege management, authentication, and network attacks. Vulnerability severity can be assessed using CVSS. Also, techniques related to AD exploitation can be described in MITRE ATT&CK, which specifies attacker tactics for gaining access to domain infrastructure. The connection with social engineering attacks (such as phishing) is also important, as attackers can use such methods to compromise AD accounts.

## How to improve
- Constantly research new vulnerabilities and exploits through open databases (e.g. CVE, CWE) and cyber attack resources.
- Practice analyzing specific vulnerabilities and attacks, develop cases to research and understand them.
- Study successful attacks and incidents to understand how attackers bypass security measures.
- Keep an eye on new social engineering methods and APT groups' approaches, study real attack scenarios.
- Complete vulnerability exploitation labs to better understand attacker techniques. Participate in CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions and labs to apply your knowledge in practice.
