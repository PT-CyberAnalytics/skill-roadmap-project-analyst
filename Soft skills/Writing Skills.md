# Writing Skills
## Description
The analyst's job, first of all, is the preparation of various reporting materials. As a rule, the Russian language and its knowledge (vocabulary, syntax, grammar) are needed to write various documents. This includes the creation of reports, documentation, recommendations and correspondence with colleagues, clients and partners. Technical literacy, as well as knowledge of specialized terminology in both languages, are necessary for the accurate and understandable presentation of information, especially in international projects or when working with foreign customers. And here it is important to note that English can also be used to prepare reports for international customers, but its main purpose is to obtain up-to-date information from professional research in its original form.

## Practice
In their day-to-day work, the analyst writes reports that describe vulnerabilities, risks, and measures to mitigate them. Literate written language is necessary to generate reports that will be understandable to both technical specialists and management. It is also sometimes necessary to correspond with colleagues from other countries or prepare documentation for international clients. Errors in written communication can lead to misunderstandings, reduced trust, or even misinterpretation of technical information.

## Connection with other knowledge
Good presentation is directly related to effective communication skills and the ability to adapt information to different audiences. Knowledge of technical terminology in both languages ​​is important for working with reports and documents.

## How to improve
- Start a technical blog and publish notes with explanations, describe your work/study activities, creating manuals and guides. Write writeups based on the results of solving labs or participating in CTF competitions.
