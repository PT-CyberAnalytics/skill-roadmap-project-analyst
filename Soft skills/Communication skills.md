# Communication skills

## Description
An analystâ€™s communication skills are not only the ability to build interaction with colleagues, customers and other specialists, but above all the skill of clearly conveying information. This includes the ability to quickly adapt the content and style of presentation to the interlocutor: it is important for technical specialists to see details and justification, and for managers to see the essence and conclusions. This approach requires internal responsiveness and flexibility in dialogue, which allows you to effectively build communication focused on results.

## Practice
The work of a security analyst requires constant interaction with various specialists: pentesters, system administrators, developers, managers and clients. For example, an analyst receives penetration test results from pentesters and needs to be able to correctly discuss the identified vulnerabilities, find out technical details and offer solutions. At the same time, when communicating with top management, it is important to be able to convincingly convey strategic risks and business consequences of incidents, avoiding complex technical terms. Participate in team learning projects - hackathons, university activities, CTFs and other team competitions and trainings that cannot be completed alone and require a distribution of roles.

## Connection with other knowledge
Communication skills are closely related to report writing and presentation skills. For example, an analyst needs to be able to present audit and pentest results in a format that is understandable to both technical specialists and management. These skills are also related to effective teamwork: correct understanding and communication of information contributes to more accurate risk assessment and development of comprehensive protection measures.

## How to improve
- Practice active listening and questioning when interacting with colleagues and customers to better understand their needs and objectives.
- Improve your skills in adapting information to the audience: explain complex technical details of pentests to technical specialists, and business risks to management, using simpler and more accessible language.
- Learn the basics of negotiation to better manage discussions, especially in situations where you need to convince someone to accept proposed security measures.
- Improve your skills in effective feedback: learn to formulate constructive comments, discuss the results of pentesters' work, and guide the team to solve identified problems.
- Regularly conduct public speaking and presentation training to confidently present audit results and reports to customers and top management.
- Participate in soft skills and communication training to improve your skills in interacting with different levels of specialists and establish effective communication in the team.
- Practice meeting with different groups of specialists to improve your ability to coordinate and collaborate with technical and non-technical teams.
