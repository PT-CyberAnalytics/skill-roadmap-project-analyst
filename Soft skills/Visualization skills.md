# Visualization skills

## Description
Visualization skills enable you to present complex ideas, data, and research findings in a clear and understandable manner. Effective visualization helps convey information to audiences of varying levels of expertise, facilitates the process of comprehension, and provides a deep understanding of key aspects of the research. Well-designed graphs, charts, diagrams, and infographics make the analystâ€™s work more persuasive, valuable, and understandable to all stakeholders.

## Practice
- The analyst applies visualization skills to:
- Create graphs and charts that clearly show trends, correlations, and key insights from large volumes of data.
- Build charts and infographics that make it easier to understand complex processes, such as cyberattacks, or information structures.
- Present research results in presentations, meetings, or analytical reports.
- Visually explain threat scenarios or recommendations for technicians and managers.
- Adapt visual style depending on the audience, be it executives, technicians or customers.

## Connection with other knowledge

Visualization skills are related to:
- Data analysis: Data processed in Excel, Python or SQL can be transformed into visual graphs or charts.
- Text editors and presentations: Visualizations are used in reports and presentations to improve the perception of information.
- Diagramming tools: Visio, draw.io or Figma help to visualize processes and structures.
