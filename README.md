# Soft Skills

## Description 

The "Soft Skills" section includes skills related to effective communication, information analysis, and work organization. These skills are necessary for interaction with colleagues, customers, and top management, as well as for the formation of clear, understandable, detailed reports and recommendations. The ability to research and search for information is also important for an analyst. This includes the ability to analyze trends and practices, the ability to work with sources, search for information in books, forums, and scientific articles. This is useful for navigating new situations, reducing dependence on third-party experts, and delivering value through the use of up-to-date data.

## Why learn this?

The ability to clearly and competently express your thoughts in written and oral form allows the analyst to correctly convey technical conclusions to different audience categories - from specialists to managers. This is important both for internal teamwork and for communication with external customers. Developing this block helps to more effectively convey your thoughts, analyze large amounts of data and find a common language with colleagues.

## How to improve

- Practice writing reports and presentations for a variety of audiences, from technical specialists to senior managers. Try to adapt the style and level of detail to specific readers.
- Participate in regular discussions and meetings to improve your oral communication skills, and learn to explain complex technical topics in simple language.
- Learn tools for working with large amounts of information (e.g. Excel) to better analyze and structure information for reports.
- Develop active listening and feedback management skills to more productively interact with colleagues and clients.
- Regularly improve your public speaking and presentation skills to confidently present your work results and recommendations.

# Hardening Basics

## Description

The "Hardening Basics" block includes practices and methods for increasing the security of systems and infrastructures to minimize the risks of their hacking. These methods cover password management, setting up antivirus protection, regularly updating systems, ensuring the secure operation of web applications, strengthening network security, and much more.

## Why learn this?

Hardening allows you to significantly reduce the risks of cyberattacks and exploitation of vulnerabilities by intruders. Knowing these basics helps to give recommendations on configuring systems in such a way as to minimize potential attack vectors and increase the security of organizations. An analyst needs to have knowledge not only of how to attack or exploit a particular vulnerability, but also be able to offer targeted recommendations that solve a particular security problem.

## How to improve

- Practice setting up secure settings for various systems: start with password management, access rights, antivirus protection and regular updates. Learn the essence of the principle of least privilege.
- Study real cyberattack incidents and analyze how basic hardening measures could prevent incidents or minimize their consequences.
- Regularly update your knowledge of best hardening practices for operating systems (Windows, Linux), web applications and network infrastructure.
- Use hardening checklists and automated tools for assessing security configurations to periodically check their compliance with best practices.

Participate in seminars and webinars to stay up to date with current methods and recommendations for strengthening security
