# Soft Skills

## Description 

The "Soft Skills" section includes skills related to effective communication, information analysis, and work organization. These skills are necessary for interaction with colleagues, customers, and top management, as well as for the formation of clear, understandable, detailed reports and recommendations. The ability to research and search for information is also important for an analyst. This includes the ability to analyze trends and practices, the ability to work with sources, search for information in books, forums, and scientific articles. This is useful for navigating new situations, reducing dependence on third-party experts, and delivering value through the use of up-to-date data.

## Why learn this?

The ability to clearly and competently express your thoughts in written and oral form allows the analyst to correctly convey technical conclusions to different audience categories - from specialists to managers. This is important both for internal teamwork and for communication with external customers. Developing this block helps to more effectively convey your thoughts, analyze large amounts of data and find a common language with colleagues.

## How to improve

- Practice writing reports and presentations for a variety of audiences, from technical specialists to senior managers. Try to adapt the style and level of detail to specific readers.
- Participate in regular discussions and meetings to improve your oral communication skills, and learn to explain complex technical topics in simple language.
- Learn tools for working with large amounts of information (e.g. Excel) to better analyze and structure information for reports.
- Develop active listening and feedback management skills to more productively interact with colleagues and clients.
- Regularly improve your public speaking and presentation skills to confidently present your work results and recommendations.

# Hardening Basics

## Description

The "Hardening Basics" block includes practices and methods for increasing the security of systems and infrastructures to minimize the risks of their hacking. These methods cover password management, setting up antivirus protection, regularly updating systems, ensuring the secure operation of web applications, strengthening network security, and much more.

## Why learn this?

Hardening allows you to significantly reduce the risks of cyberattacks and exploitation of vulnerabilities by intruders. Knowing these basics helps to give recommendations on configuring systems in such a way as to minimize potential attack vectors and increase the security of organizations. An analyst needs to have knowledge not only of how to attack or exploit a particular vulnerability, but also be able to offer targeted recommendations that solve a particular security problem.

## How to improve

- Practice setting up secure settings for various systems: start with password management, access rights, antivirus protection and regular updates. Learn the essence of the principle of least privilege.
- Study real cyberattack incidents and analyze how basic hardening measures could prevent incidents or minimize their consequences.
- Regularly update your knowledge of best hardening practices for operating systems (Windows, Linux), web applications and network infrastructure.
- Use hardening checklists and automated tools for assessing security configurations to periodically check their compliance with best practices.

Participate in seminars and webinars to stay up to date with current methods and recommendations for strengthening security

# Blue Team skills

## Description

The section is devoted to the principles, tools and methods of analyzing information security events to detect cyberattacks at any stage, as well as managing incident response in the IT infrastructure.

It combines expertise in Threat Intelligence and Threat Hunting, and also requires an understanding of the principles of infrastructure monitoring and the use of information security tools to detect attacks of any complexity. Thus, within this block, special attention is paid to understanding the stages of incident response, including detection, analysis, containment, elimination and recovery.

## Why learn this?

In projects involving presentations of the results of Blue Teams, it is important for the analyst to be able to correctly interpret the data provided for the work. Mostly, the analyst works with artifacts such as event logs, but the data may also be in other formats, for example, sometimes it is necessary to study an unknown malicious scenario and understand what the attacker was able to do with it. Based on this data, the analyst should be able to understand and correctly describe how the incident occurred, how it was detected, how it can be prevented and detected in the future, and also provide recommendations on how to strengthen the infrastructure as a whole.

## How to improve
- Learn how to work with different monitoring systems, such as SIEM (e.g. Splunk or ELK), to analyze events and correlate security-related data.
- Learn indicators of compromise (IOC) and Yara rules to identify malicious activity and detect threats in logs and traffic.
- Practice attack chain analysis based on models such as Cyber ​​Kill Chain and MITRE ATT&CK to understand at what stages of an attack they can be detected.
- Participate in incident response exercises regularly to improve your skills in monitoring and operational response to threats.
- Keep an eye on new cyberattack techniques and tactics and implement appropriate monitoring rules to detect them in a timely manner.

# Modern cyberattacks

## Description
The Modern Attacks section covers current methods used by attackers to compromise systems and infrastructure. It includes the latest cyberattack techniques, APT groups, and exploitation methods found in modern threats, including phishing, ransomware, and supply chain attacks.

## Why learn this?
Knowledge of modern attacks allows the analyst to better understand current cyber threats and predict how attackers can attack the infrastructure. This is critical for the correct assessment of incidents, identifying attack vectors and developing effective protection measures. Without this knowledge, the analyst will not be able to quickly understand current attack methods and provide recommendations for preventing incidents.

## How to improve
- Stay up-to-date with the latest cyber-attack reports, incidents, and research from leading cybersecurity companies such as Positive Technologies, Mandiant, Kaspersky, CrowdStrike.
- Study real-life attack cases such as APT groups, phishing campaigns, and ransomware attacks to understand how attackers adapt their methods to new realities and modern security systems.
- Improve your threat analysis skills related to modern attack techniques such as supply chain attacks or zero-day exploitation.
- Participate in training and exercises that simulate current attack scenarios to better understand their mechanism and detection methods.
- Read research on Dark Web threats to stay up-to-date with new tools and tactics used by attackers.
