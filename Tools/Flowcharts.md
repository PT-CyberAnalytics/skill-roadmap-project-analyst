# Flowcharts

## Description
Process diagramming and visualization tools are used to graphically represent information such as attack vectors, customer infrastructure network diagrams, and attacker activity. These tools help visualize complex systems and processes, making them understandable to technical specialists and managers. Examples include Microsoft Visio, Figma, draw.io, Lucidchart, and other similar platforms.

## Practice
An analyst uses process visualization tools to create infrastructure diagrams, data charts, or threat maps. For example, you can create a diagram of how components interact in an IT system to show potential attack points or visualize the actions of an APT group during an attack. Such diagrams are often used in reports, presentations, and analytical materials.

## Connection with other knowledge
Such tools are often used in combination with word processors and presentation tools. Diagrams and charts created in these tools can be inserted into reports and presentations to visualize data. For example, network architecture diagrams created in Visio can be included in a Word report to explain vulnerabilities in network configuration. These tools are closely related to project management, business process description, and threat modeling, making them an important part of a security analystâ€™s job.

## How to improve
- Learn to create standard diagrams and charts such as flow charts, data flow diagrams, and organizational charts.
- Practice using template libraries and pre-made elements to speed up the process of creating diagrams.
- Learn the basics of graphic design to improve the visual appeal and clarity of diagrams.
- Integrate the diagrams you create with other tools such as text editors or presentation programs.
- Practice creating visualizations of real processes or infrastructures to hone your tool skills.
- Use the collaborative features of platforms such as Figma or draw.io to collaborate with your team and discuss visualizations.
- Keep an eye on new diagramming and visualization tools to use the most convenient and functional solutions.
