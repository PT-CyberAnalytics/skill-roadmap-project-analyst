# Creating presentaions

## Description
Presentation tools are used to prepare and display information in a visual format. They allow you to create slides containing text, graphs, charts, images, and animations. Such tools are necessary for presenting analytical reports, research results, and recommendations at meetings in a simpler and more visual form. Examples of such tools include Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, Prezi, Canva, and others.

## Practice
The analyst uses presentation tools to visually present the results of their research and analysis. This may include preparing slides with data on threats implemented during the pentest, vulnerabilities discovered, and recommendations for various audiences, including technical specialists and senior managers. Presentations are also used at conferences, customer meetings, or within the team to share the results of the work.

## Connection with other knowledge
Presentation tools are directly related to text editors. Graphs and charts from Excel, diagrams from Visio or Figma are often integrated into presentations to create informative and visual materials. The ability to structure a presentation is related to the skills of presenting information, which is also important for soft skills.
