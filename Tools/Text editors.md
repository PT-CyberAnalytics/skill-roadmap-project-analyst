# Text editors

## Description
Text editors are tools for creating and editing text documents needed to prepare reports, analytical reports, technical documentation, and other materials. These tools allow you to structure information, add tables, graphs, and images, and format text for different audiences. In addition to traditional tools such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs, Markdown and LaTeX are increasingly used to format texts. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies the creation of texts with basic formatting and support in version control systems (e.g., GitHub). LaTeX is a powerful system for preparing high-quality documents, especially for technical reports containing complex formulas and structures.

## Practice
The analyst uses text editors to prepare reports. This includes structuring text, adding visual elements such as tables and charts, and using templates to standardize reports. For example, a text editor might be used to create a detailed security analysis report or to prepare recommendations for enhancing the company's security based on the results of a pentest.

## Connection with other knowledge
This block is closely related to other tools, both for preparing presentations and for drawing diagrams. For example, data can be transferred from Excel to Word in the form of tables, and final reports or conclusions can be presented in the form of presentations using PowerPoint. To create graphic elements in the report, diagrams made in MS Visio, Figma or draw.io can be used. In addition, knowledge of the report structure and formatting helps in using other security documents, such as standards and policies.

## How to improve
- Learn advanced formatting features such as styles, table of contents, and templates to create structured reports faster.
- Learn how to work with tables, charts, and graphs to better visualize data and audit results.
- Explore review capabilities such as change tracking and comments to effectively collaborate on reports with your team.
- Use built-in spell check and style check tools to ensure the quality of your writing, especially when preparing documents for external clients and management.
- Practice creating security report templates to standardize and speed up the process of documenting audit and test results.
- Explore automation capabilities to solve complex problems and streamline the reporting process.
