# Automation

## Description
Automation involves using macros, scripts, and basic programming skills to streamline routine tasks, speed up data processing, and improve analytical work efficiency. This helps automate repetitive operations such as document formatting, processing large amounts of data, or creating standard reports. The main tools for automation can be VBA in Microsoft Office, Python for data processing, and the use of basic SQL queries.

## Practice
An analyst can use automation to:
- Write macros in Excel to automate data processing, build pivot tables or graphs.
- Create simple Python scripts to work with data, such as cleaning, structuring or visualizing it.
- Automate the collection of open source intelligence (OSINT) or investigative artifacts.
- Use SQL to query databases and quickly extract the information you need.
- Integrate data from various sources, such as text files, databases and online resources.

## Connection with other knowledge
Automation is closely related to data analysis and text editor blocks. For example, Python scripts or macros can be used to process data from Excel or automatically create standard documents. Basic programming skills also help improve understanding of monitoring and reporting tools, making the analyst a more versatile specialist.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to automate work in Microsoft Office, especially Excel.
- Learn basic Python, including the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib for data visualization.
- Learn the basics of SQL to work with databases, including writing queries to select and aggregate data.
- Practice writing scripts to automate routine tasks, such as collecting data from web sources or processing large tables.
- Use real-world tasks to practice skills, such as automating the creation of individual parts of reports or processing logs.
- Keep up-to-date with current technologies and approaches to automation to use modern solutions to optimize your work.
