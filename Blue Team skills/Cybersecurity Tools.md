# Cybersecurity Tools

## Description
Cybersecurity tools include tools, technologies, and methods aimed at monitoring, detecting, and preventing cyberattacks. These tools are used to analyze security events, correlate data, detect anomalies, and respond to incidents. Main categories include SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), NDR (Network Detection and Response), as well as other specialized infrastructure monitoring and protection tools.

## Practice
It is important for an analyst to understand the functionality and operating principles of such tools as:
- SIEM systems: For example, Splunk, ELK, ArcSight. These tools aggregate and analyze data from various sources, such as network devices, event logs, security systems, etc., to identify threats and anomalies.
- EDR systems: For example, CrowdStrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. They focus on endpoint protection and provide functions for detailed analysis of activity on devices.
- NDR systems: For example, Darktrace, Vectra AI. These solutions allow you to monitor network activity and identify anomalies at the network traffic level.
- IRP platforms: Incident management platforms (for example, Palo Alto Cortex XSOAR) help automate the incident response process.

In their practice, an analyst uses data from these tools to build reports, analyze attack chains, prepare recommendations for protection, and identify bottlenecks in current security systems.

## Connection with other knowledge
Cybersecurity tools provide logs and data for analysis. SIEM and EDR are integrated to create a unified monitoring system.
Threat Intelligence: Data from information security tools can be supplemented with intelligence information to provide a more complete picture of threats.
Threat Hunting: Tools such as EDR and NDR are actively used to find hidden threats and anomalies in the system.
Attack chain analysis: Security tools help to detail the actions of attackers at each stage of the attack.

## How to improve
- Learn the basics of working with SIEM systems, their functionality, interfaces, and data correlation methods. Start with tools such as Splunk or ELK, which are widely used in the industry.
- Learn how EDR systems work, including endpoint monitoring, process analysis, and incident management.
- Explore NDR solutions for network traffic analysis and anomaly detection.
- Learn the basics of setting up and using IRP platforms to automate incident handling and manage response processes.
- Practice analyzing logs and reports provided by information security tools to develop skills in interpreting data and identifying threats.
- Keep an eye on new solutions and trends in information security tools to understand which technologies are most relevant for the current tasks of the Blue Team.
