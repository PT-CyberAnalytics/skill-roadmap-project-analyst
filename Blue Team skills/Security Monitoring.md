# Security Monitoring

## Description
Security monitoring is the process of continuously monitoring and analyzing activity on systems and networks to detect suspicious activity and potential security incidents. Monitoring systems collect data on events such as logins, configuration changes, network connections, and file operations. This data is analyzed to identify anomalies or activity that may indicate hacking attempts, malware distribution, or other threats. Event monitoring plays a key role in identifying incidents at an early stage and preventing cyber attacks.

## Practice
An analyst does not work directly with event monitoring systems such as SIEM, but receives the output of their work — logs and reports of suspicious activities. The analyst’s job is to interpret this data, identify important events, and suggest response measures. For example, if unauthorized login attempts or suspicious configuration changes are detected in the logs, the analyst must assess their significance and suggest measures to eliminate the threat. Event monitoring helps identify attacks in real time and take action before an incident becomes a serious problem.

## Connection with other knowledge
Security monitoring is closely related to other aspects of cybersecurity, such as defense tools, threat hunting, threat intelligence, indicator of compromise (IOC) analysis, incident management, and threat response. Logs and events collected by monitoring tools can be linked to attacks described in MITRE ATT&CK or Cyber ​​Kill Chain, which helps to analyze attacks in more depth. This data is also used to generate reports and recommendations for improving security. Event monitoring integrates with network protection systems and antiviruses for comprehensive infrastructure protection.

## How to improve
- Learn how event monitoring systems like SIEM work to understand how they collect and analyze data to identify threats.
- Improve your skills in interpreting security event logs and reports to quickly identify critical incidents and anomalies in system behavior.
- Become familiar with common incidents detected by event monitoring, such as unauthorized login attempts, configuration changes, or abnormal network traffic.
- Practice analyzing events from different data sources (servers, workstations, network devices) to gain a comprehensive understanding of what is happening in the infrastructure.
- Learn event correlation methods in monitoring systems to understand how different events can point to the same incident or attack.
- Stay up to date with new event monitoring technologies and tools to stay up to date with the latest solutions in real-time incident detection.
- Participate in event monitoring and analysis training and workshops to improve your skills in interpreting data and responding to security incidents.
